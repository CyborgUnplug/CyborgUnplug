# CyborgUnplug

![](https://plugunplug.net/img/site-banner.jpg)

Cyborg Unplug firmware files for the sold 16M SPI flash, 32M RAM RT5350f target
_Little Snipper_.  Please see the _wr710n_ branch for the 'homebake' DIY Atheros
target (currently TP-Link WR710N).

This firmware builds on OpenWrt BARRIER BREAKER (Bleeding Edge).

## ABOUT CYBORG UNPLUG

Cyborg Unplug is a privacy appliance for the home, hotel and workplace. It
detects and optionally disconnects (outside US only) selected devices known to
pose a risk to personal privacy, stopping streams of image, video and audio data
to the Internet (or the car outside).

Using a Virtual Private Network, this little plug also encrypts your Internet
traffic, locking out spies along the route. It can also be used to easily and
privately share files on a USB stick with others on the same network. No extra
software is required on your phone, tablet or laptop.

## BRANCH DIFFERENCES

Note the _wr710n_ branch is lagging behind _master_ due to differences in
hardware and features such as the free SSL sheathed VPN service, automatic
firmware updates and private email alerts/notification system. These are only
available with Little Snipper hardware sold due to the work involved, alongside
the financial and administrative costs of having thousands of people on the
project VPN.
