Cyborg Unplug firmware files for the retail 16M SPI flash, 32M RAM RT5350f
_USA-destined_, non-premium edition of _Little Snipper_. Unlike the International version (due
to changing FCC regulations in mid-2015) this firmware does not have the ability
to deauthenticate WiFi clients. We spent a huge amount on legal fees trying to
resolve this and, well, here's a branch to tell the tale.

This firmware builds on OpenWrt BARRIER BREAKER (Bleeding Edge).

## ABOUT CYBORG UNPLUG

Cyborg Unplug is a privacy appliance for the home, hotel and workplace. It
detects and optionally disconnects (outside US only) selected devices known to
pose a risk to personal privacy, stopping streams of image, video and audio data
to the Internet (or the car outside).

Using a Virtual Private Network, this little plug also encrypts your Internet
traffic, locking out spies along the route. It can also be used to easily and
privately share files on a USB stick with others on the same network. No extra
software is required on your phone, tablet or laptop.
