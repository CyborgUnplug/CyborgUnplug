# CyborgUnplug

Cyborg Unplug firmware files for the custom RT5350f target _Little Snipper_ and
the 'Homebake' DIY Atheros target (currently TP-Link WR710N).

Builds on OpenWrt BARRIER BREAKER (Bleeding Edge) r41679. 

## Branch differences

Please note the wr710n branch is lagging far behind master currently due to
differences in hardware and features such as the free VPN service, which is only
available with Little Snipper hardware sold.

I will get around to aligning the branches shortly, so expect big changes if
you're flashing the wr710n firmware currently.
